## Executive Summary

Snakebite envenoming is a WHO-recognized Neglected Tropical Disease, and India carries one of the highest snakebite mortality burdens in the world, with rural and semi-urban populations facing the compounded problem of misidentifying species in the field and delaying — or mismanaging — first response. Most existing tools address only one half of this problem: either a visual species classifier with no actionable guidance, or a static first-aid pamphlet with no adaptive intelligence. **SnakeSense** is built to close that gap by fusing computer vision, structured clinical logic, and retrieval-grounded language generation into a single, safety-first pipeline.

The system is engineered as three cooperating subsystems behind one FastAPI backend: an **EfficientNet-B0** image classifier fine-tuned to distinguish 15 snake species relevant to the Indian subcontinent, returning ranked predictions enriched with toxicity classification, venom type, and localized common names in English, Hindi, and Gujarati; a **rule-based clinical triage engine** that converts a symptom questionnaire into a WHO/NCDC-aligned urgency classification (`CRITICAL` / `HIGH` / `LOW`) with explicit do's-and-don'ts action protocols; and a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant**, built on ChromaDB, that answers free-text questions about species behavior and emergency response strictly grounded in indexed, verified wildlife and medical knowledge — engineered to avoid hallucinated clinical claims.

The engineering intent throughout is *safety-first, not confidence-first*: predictions below a 40% confidence threshold are explicitly flagged as low-confidence/ambiguous rather than silently presented as certain, every `/predict` response carries a mandatory non-diagnostic disclaimer, and the triage logic is deliberately conservative — deferring to `CRITICAL` classification whenever neurotoxic or haemotoxic red-flag symptoms (ptosis, respiratory difficulty, spontaneous bleeding) are present. The result is a project that demonstrates production-style ML engineering (checkpoint-driven model loading, typed request/response schemas, lifespan-managed startup, CORS-enabled multi-client access) applied to a domain where getting the interface right matters as much as getting the model right.

---

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Diagnostic Pipeline** — A single Streamlit interface unifies image-based species identification, structured symptom triage, and open-ended conversational Q&A into one clinical workflow rather than three disconnected tools.
- **Confidence-Aware Vision Inference** — The classifier doesn't just return a top prediction; it returns a full top-3 ranked list, computes softmax-calibrated confidence, and explicitly raises a `is_low_confidence` flag below a 40% threshold so ambiguous or blurry images are never silently over-trusted.
- **WHO/NCDC-Aligned Clinical Triage Logic** — A deterministic rules engine maps reported symptoms (ptosis, dyspnea, spontaneous bleeding, local swelling, time elapsed since bite) directly to an urgency tier and a structured `dos` / `donts` action protocol, rather than relying on a language model to reason about emergency medicine live.
- **Grounded RAG Assistant** — Free-text questions are answered by an LLM constrained to a ChromaDB-indexed knowledge base, engineered to reduce hallucination risk on high-stakes queries like "what do I do if bitten by a Common Krait at night."
- **Trilingual by Design** — Species common names and the assistant's language mode are natively surfaced in **English, Hindi (हिंदी), and Gujarati (ગુજરાતી)**, reflecting the real linguistic context of rural snakebite incidents in India.
- **Session-Aware Context Injection** — The chat assistant carries forward the "active species context" from a user's most recent image upload within the same session, so follow-up questions don't require re-stating which snake was identified.
- **Typed, Contract-First API Surface** — Every endpoint (`/predict`, `/triage`, `/chat`, `/health`) is backed by explicit Pydantic response models, giving the system a stable, versionable contract instead of ad-hoc JSON.
- **Lifespan-Managed Model & Index Loading** — The FastAPI `lifespan` context loads the model checkpoint, class mapping, and RAG knowledge base index exactly once at startup rather than per-request, keeping inference latency low and avoiding redundant I/O.

## System Architecture & Pipeline

SnakeSense is architected around a single FastAPI application (`app/main.py`) that owns model lifecycle, request validation, and routing, fronted by a Streamlit multi-tab client (`app_ui.py`). The backend loads its EfficientNet-B0 checkpoint and class mapping once at process startup via a `lifespan` context manager, and simultaneously triggers `index_knowledge_base()` to prepare the ChromaDB vector store for the RAG assistant — meaning the first request served is already warm.

Each of the three user-facing capabilities routes to an isolated concern: `/predict` is a pure computer-vision path (image in, ranked species predictions out), `/triage` is a pure deterministic-logic path (symptom JSON in, urgency classification out, **no model inference involved**), and `/chat` is the only path that touches the LLM, and only after retrieval has grounded it in indexed source material.

### Data Ingestion & Model Pipeline

The vision model's path from raw image to structured prediction follows a fixed preprocessing contract that must match training-time normalization exactly, since any mismatch here silently degrades accuracy without raising an error.

> [!NOTE]
> The `/triage` endpoint is intentionally excluded from any model or LLM call path. Emergency urgency classification is computed by deterministic conditional logic in `main.py` alone — a design choice made so that clinical urgency decisions are auditable, reproducible, and not subject to model drift or hallucination.

## Machine Learning & Engineering Deep Dive

### Model Architecture

The deployed classifier is a **EfficientNet-B0** (`torchvision.models.efficientnet_b0`), instantiated with `weights=None` (trained from scratch on the project's own dataset rather than fine-tuned from ImageNet weights in the deployed loader) and re-headed for the task: the final classifier layer's `in_features` is extracted and replaced with a fresh `nn.Linear(num_features, num_classes)` sized to the 15 registered species. Trained weights are restored from a checkpoint at `checkpoints/best_model.pth`, with the loader handling both raw state-dict checkpoints and dictionary-wrapped checkpoints (`checkpoint["model_state_dict"]`) for flexibility across training run formats.

### Preprocessing Contract

Inference-time preprocessing is defined as a fixed `torchvision.transforms.Compose` pipeline, deliberately kept identical to the validation-time transform used during training:

```python
eval_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((256, 256)),
    transforms.CenterCrop((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(
        mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
        std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    )
])
```

### Class Mapping & Species Metadata

The 15-class label space is externalized to `models/class_mapping.json`, loaded and cast to an `int → str` mapping at startup. Each predicted class index is resolved to a scientific name, which is then enriched via `species_db.get_species_info()` — returning `common_name`, `local_names` (a dict keyed by language code for English/Hindi/Gujarati), `toxicity_status`, `venom_type`, and an `is_big_four` flag (referencing India's "Big Four" medically significant venomous species: Indian cobra, common krait, Russell's viper, and saw-scaled viper).

### Confidence Calibration & Low-Confidence Safeguard

Raw logits are converted to probabilities via `torch.softmax`, and the top-3 classes are extracted via `torch.topk`. Critically, the system does not treat the top-1 prediction as ground truth by default — if the top prediction's confidence falls below **40%**, the response sets `is_low_confidence = True`, which the UI surfaces as an explicit warning: *"The image may be blurry or ambiguous. Treat as potentially venomous."* This is a deliberate fail-safe bias — under identification uncertainty, the system defaults toward caution rather than false reassurance.

### Logged Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Backbone** | EfficientNet-B0 | `torchvision.models.efficientnet_b0`, custom 15-class head |
| **Top-3 Test Accuracy** | **87.24%** | Formally logged during test-set evaluation |
| **Inference Latency** | **< 100 ms / image** | Measured on GPU/CUDA |
| **Classes Registered** | **15 species** | Indices `0`–`14`, sourced from `class_mapping.json` |
| **Per-Species Precision / Recall** | *Not logged* | Not recorded in the training run logs — flagged here rather than estimated |
| **Confusion Matrix** | *Not logged* | Full per-class confusion matrix was not captured during this training run |


### Clinical Triage Logic

The `/triage` endpoint implements a fully deterministic decision tree — no model inference occurs on this path. Given a `bitten` flag and four boolean symptom fields (`local_swelling`, `drooping_eyelids`, `difficulty_breathing`, `spontaneous_bleeding`) plus `time_elapsed_minutes`, urgency is classified as follows:

- If `bitten` is `False` → `urgency_level = "LOW"`, no bite reported, maintain safe distance.
- If any of `drooping_eyelids`, `difficulty_breathing`, or `spontaneous_bleeding` is `True` → `urgency_level = "CRITICAL"`, `suspected_toxicity = "Systemic Envenoming (Neurotoxic / Haemotoxic)"`.
- Otherwise (bitten, but none of the critical red-flag symptoms present) → `urgency_level = "HIGH"`, `suspected_toxicity = "Potential Local Envenoming"`.

Every triage response returns a structured `action_protocol` with an `immediate_action` string, a `dos` list (immobilize the limb, remove restrictive jewelry, transport to a facility with antivenom/ICU access), and a `donts` list (no incision, no suction, no tourniquet, no herbal remedies or ice, no alcohol/caffeine/analgesics) — directly reflecting standard WHO/NCDC snakebite first-aid guidance.

### RAG Assistant Design

The `/chat` endpoint delegates to `generate_rag_answer(user_query, species_context, language)` in `app/rag_engine.py`. The knowledge base is indexed once at application startup via `index_knowledge_base()` inside the FastAPI `lifespan` handler, backed by ChromaDB as the vector store. The assistant accepts an optional `species_context` string — populated automatically by the UI from the most recently identified species in the session — allowing follow-up questions like *"is this one dangerous at night?"* to resolve without the user re-stating which snake they mean.

## Getting Started & Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **CUDA-capable GPU** (recommended): for sub-100ms inference latency; the app auto-detects and falls back to CPU otherwise (`torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")`)
- **Core dependencies**: PyTorch, torchvision, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Streamlit, Pillow, ChromaDB, Pydantic, Pytest


### Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Samirhadiyal/SnakeSense.git
cd SnakeSense

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision fastapi uvicorn streamlit pillow chromadb pydantic pytest

# 4. Ensure model artifacts are present
#    - checkpoints/best_model.pth   (trained EfficientNet-B0 weights)
#    - models/class_mapping.json    (15-class label mapping)
#    Generate these by running snakesense.ipynb end-to-end, or place
#    pre-trained artifacts in these exact paths.

# 5. Start the FastAPI backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# 6. In a separate terminal, start the Streamlit UI
streamlit run app_ui.py
```

The Streamlit UI expects the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default (hardcoded `API_URL` in `app_ui.py`) — update this constant if deploying the backend elsewhere.

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
